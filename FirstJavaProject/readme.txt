To run HelloWorld.java on the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the java file
and then type  

1. javac HelloWorld.java

2. java -cp . HelloWorld

The first line compiles the source code into executable byte code. The second line executes it, 
first adding the current directory to the class path (just in case).
